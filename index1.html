          Before I met God, I lived like a man wandering in a fog — priorities scrambled, purpose unclear. Small compromises
          became habits; my identity was tethered to achievements and approval. I chased the high of applause and the illusion of success,
          until one encounter changed everything.

        <h1 class="font-bold">Who I Was Before God Found Me</h1>
        <p class="font-bold font-medium">
         1. I Was Driven by Fear, Not Purpose </p>

        <h3>I looked productive , always busy, always in motion  but behind the busyness was fear.
        <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic">Fear of failing. </p>
         <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic">Fear of being rejected.</p></div>
        <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic">Fear of disappointing people.</p></div>
        <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic">Fear of not being “enough.”</p></div> 
        </div> 
        <p class="mb-4">I said “yes” to everything because I wanted people to like me. I served in church, but my identity depended on applause. When someone praised me, I felt alive. When no one noticed my effort, I felt empty and invisible.</p>
        </h3>
        <p class="font-bold font-medium">2. I Was a Master of Double Life</p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">I smiled publicly but carried habits privately that were destroying me.
          There were seasons when I was deep into unhealthy coping mechanisms — late-night escaping, wasting hours on digital distractions, watching things I shouldn’t watch, and pretending that “I’m fine.”
          One example:There was a night when I felt so stressed that instead of praying, I binge-watched shows until 4 a.m., knowing I had ministry the next day. I preached with no sleep and a guilty heart, pretending everything was okay. I had turned ministry into performance because my personal life lacked integrity.
        </h3>
         <p class="font-bold font-medium">3. I Was Self-Centered Without Realizing It</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">I helped people because it made me feel good.
I served because it made me look responsible.
I said spiritual words but lacked spiritual substance.

My prayers were short, my temper was short, and my patience was even shorter. I would snap at people quietly, get irritated fast, and then excuse myself thinking, “I’m just tired.”

The truth?
        I was spiritually empty.</h3>

       <h1 class="font-bold">The encounter</h1>
        
        <p>
                  One evening, during a volunteer outreach, I felt an unshakeable peace and a conviction about truth, grace, and responsibility.
                 It wasn't dramatic fireworks — just a deep, quiet repositioning of my heart. It wasn’t during a worship service.
                  It wasn’t during a big revival meeting.It was alone. One night. Just me, my guilt, and God. That night I opened my Bible, not out of devotion but out of duty. And the words hit me differently: “Having a form of godliness but denying its power.” It felt like someone put a mirror in front of my soul. I felt exposed. All my pretending, all my double life, all my hidden struggles — God saw everything.</p>

        <div><p class="font-semibold">But instead of condemnation, I felt something unexpected:
          an invitation.</p>

        <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic">An invitation to stop pretending.</p>
        <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic">An invitation to come clean.</p>
        <div><p class="text-gray-600 italic mb-4">An invitation to be healed.</p>

        <p>For the first time, I dropped the act. I confessed everything — the pride, the addiction to approval, the hidden habits, the exhaustion, the fears. It felt like a spiritual surgery where God cut deep but He also healed deeply.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-900 italic mb-4">That encounter broke me… in the best possible way.</p>
        </p>
        <h1 class="font-bold">How God Changed Me — Specifically</h1>
      <p class="font-medium mb-4">1. He Rewrote My Identity</p>

      <p>I realized I didn’t need to impress anyone — God already knew the worst parts of me and still chose me.</p>
      <p>I realized I didn’t need to impress anyone — God already knew the worst parts of me and still chose me.</p>
      <p>I became less performance-driven and more purpose-driven.</p>
      <p>I learned to say “no” without guilt.</p>
      <p>I learned to say “no” without guilt.</p>
      <p>I stopped chasing applause and started chasing obedience.</p>
    <p class="font-medium mb-4">2. Hidden Habits Lost Their Power</p>

The addictions and unhealthy patterns I carried for years didn’t vanish overnight, but their grip weakened dramatically.
<p>I stopped running to screens for comfort.</p>
<p>I stopped numbing myself with endless entertainment.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Prayer became my first response, not my last resort.</p>

<p>One specific change:</p>
<p class="mb-4">I deleted apps that triggered old habits and replaced late-night escapes with nightly devotions. It felt like taking back territory the enemy stole for years.</p>

<p class="font-bold mb-4">3. My Relationships Transformed</p>

<p>I became less argumentative, less reactive, and less demanding.
People felt safer around me because I finally learned to listen without judgment.

Even my apologies changed. Before, I rarely admitted mistakes.
Now, I apologize quickly — not because I’m weak, but because grace makes me humble.</p>

<h1 class="font-bold mb-4">4. My Perspective on Success Shifted</h1>

<p>Before, success meant:</p>

<p>Being recognized</p>
<p>Being applauded</p>
<p>Being needed</p>
<p>Being praised</p>

<h1 class="font-bold mb-4">Now, success means something far simpler and far deeper:</h1>

<p>✔ A clean heart</p>
<p>✔ Faithfulness in the small things</p>
<p>✔ Obedience even when unseen</p>
<p>✔ Loving people the way Christ loves me</p>
<p>✔ Living with integrity</p>

Success for me today is not “How many people saw what I did?” but “Did God smile at what I did?”

How My Life Looks Now

I didn’t become perfect — far from it — but I became different.

I wake up with clarity instead of fear.

I serve because I’m called, not because I need validation.

I guard my habits because my heart matters more than my image.

I plan my days with purpose instead of pressure.

I pursue holiness, not hype.

I rest without feeling guilty.

But the biggest change?
I finally know who I am — not because of what I do, but because of who God is.

My Life After Transformation

God didn’t just fix a few behaviors.
He rebuilt me from the inside out.

He took a fearful, approval-driven, double-life believer and turned me into someone who values integrity, mission, and quiet obedience.

He replaced my insecurity with identity.
He replaced my guilt with grace.
He replaced my performance mentality with purpose.

And now, everything I do — preaching, ministry, studying, serving — flows from a place of relationship, not pressure.

If there’s one thing my story proves, it’s this:

God doesn’t just change your habits — He changes your heart.
And when your heart changes, everything else follows.

        <h2>What changed</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Priorities became people-centered (relationships over résumé).</li>
          <li>Success was redefined: obedience + fruitfulness, not applause.</li>
          <li>Daily rhythms changed: prayer, Scripture, Sabbath rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you are reading this, let it encourage you: one genuine encounter reorients the whole life. The result is not perfection — it's
          a faithful journey.
